We're happy to incorporate all improvements to JPlag into this codebase. Feel free to fork the project and send pull requests.
If you are new to JPlag, maybe check the [good first issues](https://github.com/jplag/jplag/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

Please try to make well-documented and clear structured submissions:
* All artifacts (code, comments...) should be in English
* Please avoid abbreviations!
* Make use of JavaDoc to document classes and public methods
* We provide a [formatter configuration](https://github.com/jplag/JPlag/blob/master/formatter.xml), which is enforced by spotless
    * Eclipse/IntelliJ users can use it directly
    * It can always be applied via maven with `mvn spotless:apply`
* Use well-explained pull requests to propose your features
* When re-using code from other projects mark them accordingly and make sure their license allows the re-use
* Your changes should always improve the code quality of the codebase, especially when working on older components
* Your git messages should be concise but more importantly descriptive
* Ensure your git history is clean, or else your PR may get squashed while merging
